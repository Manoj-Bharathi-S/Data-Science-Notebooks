# Data-Science-Notebooks 📊

Welcome to my collection of data science projects and notebooks\! This repository is a showcase of my work in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. The projects are stored as Jupyter Notebooks, providing a clear, step-by-step walkthrough of the data science process, from data cleaning to model building and interpretation.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The notebooks are organized by project or topic to make them easy to navigate. Each folder contains a self-contained project with its own data and notebook(s).

```
└── Retail Sales Analysis
    ├── Retail Sales Analysis.ipynb
    ├── requirements.txt
    └── retail_sales_dataset.csv

```

## 🚀 Projects

Here are some of the key projects you'll find in this repository:

### 1\. Retail Sales Analysis

**Notebook:** `retail_sales_analysis/retail_sales_analysis.ipynb`
This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a retail sales dataset.

  - **Skills:** Data cleaning, time-series analysis, and data visualization with `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
  - **Insights:** Gained insights into sales trends, top-performing product categories, and customer purchasing behavior.


## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

This repository primarily uses the following tools:

  - **Python**: The core programming language for all analyses.
  - **Jupyter Notebook**: The interactive environment used to create the notebooks.
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
  - **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning tasks.


## ▶️ How to Run the Notebooks

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Data-Science-Notebooks.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Data-Science-Notebooks/Retail_Sales_Analysis
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *(Note: You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file listing all dependencies.)*

4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

5.  Open the desired `.ipynb` file from the browser and run the cells.
